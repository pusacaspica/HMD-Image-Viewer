Sorry for messing up formatting, time is of the essence
This is a slideshow for a very specific goal: comparing pairs of images in a random order. This is not that elegant since it was done for personal use only, but I can work on it if there is demand for upgrading the user experience!

To load your own images:
 - put your images on the Resources folder
 - set the prefix variables on the SlideController script within Unity
 - set the slideshow parameters (such as time in seconds for each image and time between images) at the TestRoutineController script within Unity
 - (the scripts can be found at the Plane within the SampleScene)

While running, controls are: 
 - S for starting the random passing of each pair
 - F changes the image of the pair
 - 1-9 switches between images 1 to 9 (the slideshow should behave if you put more images)
 - arrow keys for passing between images
